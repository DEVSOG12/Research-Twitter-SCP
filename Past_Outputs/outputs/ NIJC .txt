Tweet Created on 2021-09-30 17:01:00+00:00 :25 yrs ago today, Pres. Clinton signed #IIRIRA, an anti-immigrant law that has led to tens of thousands of deportations by radically expanding detention &amp; deportation and deportable offenses. To this day, Congress has refused to act and repeal this inhumane law.

Tweet Created on 2021-09-30 17:47:01+00:00 :Laws like #IIRIRA, signed by Pres. Clinton 25 yrs ago created the mass detention and deportation system we have today. This law made it possible for local police to serve as immigration agents, expanded the grounds for deportation, and eliminated due process for many immigrants.
