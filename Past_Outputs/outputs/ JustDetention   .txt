Tweet Created on 2022-08-12 19:15:07+00:00 :It is NOT okay to wish rape on anyone.  

It doesn't matter if the person is alleged to have done something illegal. It doesn't matter if the person actually has done something illegal.

It just doesn't matter. Rape is never okay. Period.

Tweet Created on 2022-08-22 23:31:55+00:00 :Some think that people who break that law deserve sexual abuse — that “if you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime.”
