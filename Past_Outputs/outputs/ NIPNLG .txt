Tweet Created on 2021-10-06 19:09:15+00:00 :#IIRIRA, signed by Pres. Clinton in 1996, dramatically expanded grounds for deportation, including for legal permanent residents. The law also strengthened collaboration between ICE &amp; police that funnel people into detention.

It’s time to repeal this inhumane law! #NewWayForward

Tweet Created on 2021-10-06 19:16:08+00:00 :In 1996, Congress passed #IIRIRA, an anti-immigrant law that made detention and deportation a mandatory minimum. Since then, immigrant detention and deportations have skyrocketed and the jail-to-deportation pipeline continues to harm our communities.
