A3: It‚Äôs important for people to know about #ICWA because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for Native kids. ICWA is in the best interest of Native children and it's a federal law‚Äîthere are minimum standards in place that states need to follow when kids are in their care. #ICWAforFamilies
A2: ICWA ensures that Native children know who they are and where they come from. ICWA offers a strong sense of connection and belonging to their families, communities, and cultures. #ICWAforFamilies
A1: Consistent with other federal child welfare laws, ICWA protects children and families by engaging extended families and keeping Native children with their families and communities whenever possible. #ICWAforFamilies
Children are best served by preserving as many connections with their birth and extended family and community as possible. ICWA lessens trauma from unnecessary removal by requiring active efforts early on to support families. #ICWAforFamilies https://t.co/kZPef1eKyX

Research clearly shows children placed with their extended family develop strong attachments and have better long-term outcomes than children in non-kinship care placements. The 'only family' argument is not factually based and needs to end.
