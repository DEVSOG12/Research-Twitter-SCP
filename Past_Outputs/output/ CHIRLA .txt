"Our immigration laws are outdated and no longer serve the purpose for which they were created. Reforming our family, employment, and diversity systems would be in the best interest of our economy and our communities."

An outdated system hurts our communities and our U.S. economy. We can't allow the inaction of congress to continue this suffering! #YEStoImmigrantsForward #YEStoCitizenship
