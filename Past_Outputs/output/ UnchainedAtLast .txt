The number of #childmarriages in the U.S. has declined nearly every year, but it won't get to zero w/o legislative intervention. We need to pass legislation to set the marriage age at #18NoExceptions in every U.S. state &amp; territory to #EndChildMarriage. https://t.co/sC7mGvO7bY https://t.co/PRfGczZBMS
#ChildMarriage has little chance of escape for children. The limited legal rights of minors often prohibit them from filing for divorce, effectively creating a legal trap until age 18. Learn more at https://t.co/kYpGltmhwB https://t.co/H4jrncXSro

But to be clear, #NorthCarolina is not "outlawing #childbrides." They're leaving those most at risk of #childmarriage -- 16- and 17-year-olds -- completely vulnerable. This bill will do little to actually #EndChildMarriage. https://t.co/GXQi6N6TYA

Many states allow #childmarriage w/ parental "consent." But this isn't the safeguard it's presented to be: When a child is forced to marry, the perpetrators are almost always the parents. Parental “consent” often is parental “coercion.” Learn more: https://t.co/nO1o2P24uy. https://t.co/eib6zdUgsg

#VomitociousExcuses for #ClingingtoChildMarriage: “Some of us do think you should not have sexual relations outside of marriage.” 

OK...you'd prefer legalized rape? Not only is that unrealistic, it's dangerous. #ChildMarriage has been used to marry girls off to their rapists. https://t.co/nhYSlvblph

#PuertoRico and #USVI already ended marriage before 18! The age of adulthood in Puerto Rico is 21, though, so to really #EndChildMarriage, their law needs to be #21NoExceptions. But the U.S. Virgin Islands ended #childmarriage in 2020! @javanjamesvi https://t.co/kTdI2EZ6bf
