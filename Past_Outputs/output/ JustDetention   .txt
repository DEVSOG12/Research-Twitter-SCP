It's long been time for the media to shift away from using “inmate,” a word many incarcerated people find offensive and dehumanizing. 

People who are locked up are still people. Let’s use language that recognizes this.
Some think that people who break that law deserve sexual abuse — that “if you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime.”

We believe that this mindset is dangerous. Prisoner rape is a devastating crime that destroys lives and affects us all — a crime that can, and must, be stopped.

It is NOT okay to wish rape on anyone.  

It doesn't matter if the person is alleged to have done something illegal. It doesn't matter if the person actually has done something illegal.

It just doesn't matter. Rape is never okay. Period.

ICYMI: Judge tells defendant that he's on his way to being "Bubba’s new best girlfriend at the state penitentiary.”

It's horrible when pop culture endorses rape in prison. When judges do it, it's even worse.

Reporting sexual abuse in prison is difficult. It's the job of corrections staff to make feel comfortable coming forward. 

For a survivor at Rikers, the opposite happened. After he bravely came forward, they called him "Mr. 311" and "the Grievance King."

"Maybe what happened to me can open up doors to prevent rape from happening to others. Prisons need to be safe. We can make them safe.” Dwight, a prisoner rape survivor and member of JDI's Survivor Council
Any time there's a high-profile court case or a national discussion of possible criminal behavior, many people feel the need to make prisoner rape jokes. Can we resolve to not do that? Rape is NEVER part of the penalty.

It takes courage to talk about personal trauma. People who share painful experiences should be treated compassionately, and *never* denigrated. When we create spaces for people to open up, it leads to healthier communities.

We think about this quote, from survivor Isak Sass: "The greatest tragedy is not what happened to me in prison. The greatest tragedy will be for me and us to fail to stop this from happening to others and to forget about those who are still at risk of violence."

Our criminal justice system is plagued by racism. The school-to-prison pipeline is fueled by bias in which adults treat black girls as older than they are — and punish them more harshly. They are 7x more likely to be suspended than white girls and 4x more likely to be arrested.

When the government takes away someone’s freedom, it takes on an absolute responsibility to keep that person safe. This principle is especially vital in a time of mass arrests. If a city cannot ensure the safety of people who are arrested, then it must stop making arrests.

Kudos to Senators @brianschatz  @JohnCornyn for urging that the federal prison system do a better job ensuring the dignity of prisoners. This joint letter shows that when it comes to stopping prisoner rape, liberals and conservatives aren't so different.   https://t.co/m07i8fCORR
Prisoner rape survivors inform all of JDI's work. By placing their experiences center of our work, we can transform prison culture.
It used to be the case that when a famous person was convicted of a hideous crime, a flood of prisoner rape jokes would follow. While those jokes are still out there, it's heartening to see many so people chiming in to say that rape is not part of the penalty.
Always remember that prisoner rape survivors are fellow human beings — family members, friends, neighbors.
"Sharing my story with others empowers me as a survivor. I want people to know I am the face of a prison rape survivor — and not a prison rape victim." Read Ca'Linda's story here: https://t.co/Rxh1RQxG24
Prisoner rape survivors need and deserve our compassion. As one survivor told us, "It really means a lot to have someone in society looking at me and seeing me as a human being and not just another number that no one cares about.”

Every year, 200,000 men, women, and children are sexually abused behind bars. This violence is a nationwide crisis — but it's a crisis we can end.

It is still commonly felt that prisoners are less deserving of our sympathy. And yet, if every person has equal value — if human rights are inalienable — we have to care deeply about people in detention, and do everything we can to make others care too.

These powerful words, spoken by former President @BarackObama in July 2015, still resonate: "We should not be tolerating rape in prison. And we should not be making jokes about it in our popular culture. That’s no joke. These things are unacceptable."

Once more for the back: rape is NEVER OKAY. Period. It doesn't matter what crime a person committed, or how strongly you dislike them or their political beliefs.
Here's the thing about the prisoner rape joke on @nbcsnl from this weekend. It's not just that Michael Che made a joke about inmates being raped for the second consecutive week. (1/2)

Some people think that anyone who breaks the law deserves sexual abuse. As the saying goes, “If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime.” At JDI, we believe that tropes about prisoner rape — and prisoners themselves — are an obstacle to ending the crisis of rape behind bars.
