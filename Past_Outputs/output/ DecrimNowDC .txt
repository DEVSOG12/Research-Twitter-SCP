Knowing your rights is extremely important especially during #COVID-19. It can prevent or mitigate some illegal searches but it shouldn’t be on you to keep yourself safe from police. The only way to end stop-and-frisk is to ban it. #NoMoreStopandFrisk #StopMPD https://t.co/24bcGIsYPi

Evidence shows that partial decriminalization of sex work—where buying sex is criminalized—hurts people in the sex trades.

Full decriminalization is what will actually keep people safe...it can help decrease trafficking.

By removing the fear of criminalization, decriminalizing consensual sex work actually makes it easier for sex workers to safely live their lives as they choose to do so. Sex workers accessing housing or lodging is a human right to safety, not a privilege.

Black trans people face so much discrimination, hostility, and abuse when seeking medical care. 

Misgendering, poor quality and harmful care, neglect, and more. 

We gotta end that abuse. We gotta end that discrimination. We gotta create a better world for Black trans people.

Cops harm sex workers under the pretense of ending trafficking.

Police just arrested 9 people in a "bust" in Virginia. The cops acknowledged that there was no trafficking, but they still threw them all in jail, publicized their names to the media, and gave them criminal records.

Until all of our families are safe and together, we will organize, take the streets and fight back. 

Until our community is free from cages and police violence, we will fight for and protect each other. 

None of us are free until all of us are free.
