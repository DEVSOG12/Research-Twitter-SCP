A4.1. Our #CJsystem is rife with systemic racism, and plea bargaining is no different. 

Ex: The odds of receiving a plea offer that includes incarceration are almost 70 percent greater for Black people than white people. #RethinkJails https://t.co/wZMhDEUEvz https://t.co/NbssxeOPLi

#JuneteenthDay marks the day when federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas in 1865 to ensure that all enslaved people be freed.

After the deaths of George Floyd and many other Black people at the hands of police, protestors have demanded that cities, “defund the police.” What do they mean?

Our explainer provides perspectives &amp; offers ways to bring change to policing.

After George Floyd's death, protestors shouted: "defund the police." But what do they mean? Some call for cuts to high police budgets &amp; to invest in communities. Others seek police abolition.

By May 13th, at least 25,239 people in prison tested positive for #COVID19—a 25% increase from the previous week.

If it isn't clear by now, we need to decarcerate our local jails and prisons to protect our communities and people inside the justice system.

People with incarceration history often face challenges after release. These barriers can deny them certain housing opportunities, leaving some homeless. When staying "home" can help prevent the spread of #COVID19, no one should be left without one.
