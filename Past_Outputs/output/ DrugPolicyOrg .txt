People use drugs. So how should we respond?

üìåLaws &amp; policies with a health-based approach, not criminalization
üìåSobriety is an option, but not the only option
üìåHarm reduction
üìåSupport, not punishment
üìåRespecting bodily autonomy

#MothersDay can bring up many feelings for people navigating drug use: anger towards a system that criminalizes, instead of helps; complicated feelings towards a parent who uses drugs, grief when losing a child to overdose, among others.

As the overdose crisis grows, U.S leaders call for more punitive approaches that harm people. The recent vote by the CO Senate in favor of harsher penalties on fentanyl does nothing to reduce a tainted drug supply but will stop people from getting help.

Thank you @SenSchumer for being a champion of justice by continuing to hold strong to keep the SAFE Banking Act out of the National Defense Authorization Act. Please keep making sure that Congress doesn‚Äôt prioritize banking, profits, and big business before long overdue equity...
Americans agree that criminalization of marijuana ruins lives. 19 states have already legalized marijuana, but the nation‚Äôs patchwork of laws means someone is still arrested for marijuana every 90 secs.

Criminalization fuels the overdose crisis. It creates stigma and fear of punishment which prevents people from seeking support and pushes people to use alone so they have no help in an overdose emergency. #DecriminalizeDrugs https://t.co/MRic6twKKU

Don‚Äôt judge someone‚Äôs survival. While the majority of people who use drugs don‚Äôt do so chaotically, we need to understand root causes of problematic drug use: poverty, trauma, etc. Many use drugs to cope with physical and emotional pain‚Ä¶ trying to stay awake (i.e. survival).

The San Diego Sheriff released a PSA, falsely claiming that a police officer suffered an overdose as a result of simply touching fentanyl.  Not true. This myth leads to harmful policies that over criminalize/harm, but don't help people.

Overdose is driven by criminalization.

Criminalization pushes people to the sidelines. It pushes people into risky situations. It pushes people to use alone. It pushes people to fear asking for help if they need it. #DecriminalizeDrugs

Can using #heroin once make you addicted? 

We share the facts without judgment or hysteria. To understand a drug, you need to understand its effects, why people use it, and the risk it poses in terms of both health and criminal penalties. https://t.co/MAd3bxia1x https://t.co/ACOpLKwinh

Is it time to decriminalize drugs?
The women at DPA are critical to the movement to end the racist and inhumane drug war. They helped to decriminalize all drugs in Oregon. Now, let‚Äôs #DecriminalizeDrugs across the country.

The devastating harms of the drug war have been well documented over the past 50 years. 

What's less well documented are the ways it's been a barrier to research &amp; science. 

Join us on 6/24 to explore how we can generate research and policy solutions: https://t.co/2ViG2b4rnL https://t.co/GBK99FLIU7

For 30 yrs, drug war policies have banned ppl w/ felony drug convictions from receiving public benefits. The drug war inappropriately brands ppl who use or are suspected of using drugs as undeserving of public assistance.
