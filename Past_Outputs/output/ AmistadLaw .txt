Instead of papering over problems with the violence of the police and incarceration, we should mobilize resources and deal with problems at their root.

✅Police Budgets
✅Prison Budgets
✅Gun Violence 

Spending more on prisons and police has not made us safer, because wealth inequality, poverty and community divestment is at the root of the gun violence crisis.
We all want to be protected. It’s a seductive idea that if we spend more on policing that we will be safer. It’s also wrong.

With record high police budgets we also have a record high gun violence spike.

A shamefully sensationalist title! This man was not even in the car fleeing a robbery that crashed killing four people. But because he took part in the robbery he was convicted of felony murder. 

Life without parole sentencing is extreme and must end.

Black history isn’t a month. It’s a verb.

Both things are true: people do harmful things and most people change over the years. 

The idea that we should lock people up and throw away the key without ever giving them a second look accepts one truth and denies the other. 

Parole eligibility for lifers is a must.

As we near the Jewish High Holidays we’re thinking of some of our friends and clients at SCI-Phoenix who won’t be able to worship together yet again. 

Many are rehabilitated and aging and should be returned to the community where they can worship freely.

As the epidemic of gun violence continues to impact our communities it is clearer than ever. If policing was the solution we wouldn’t have this problem in the first place. 

Our communities need resources to interrupt the cycle of violence. https://t.co/GwzwR12KeK
The idea that police and prisons keep us safer is just an ideology. 

We spend more than anywhere in the world on locking people up yet witness the gun violence on our streets right now. 

We need solutions that move resources to end structural inequality to heal our communities.

We must stop incarcerating people until they are old and grey with no possibility of a second look. Medical parole initiatives that exclude age as a condition are misguided. 

We need geriatric parole NOW so our elders can return to our communities.

Last week just 6 lifers were approved for September public hearings by the Board of Pardons. At those hearings we will shine a light and call on @FettermanLt @PAAttorneyGen and all Board members to vote yes on second chances.

The Board will vote on whether to hear 15 commutation applications, as well as well 2 reconsiderations. We need #SecondChances now.
Great reporting by @JasGarsd about ‘violence interrupter’ programs where people with street credibility are resourced to interrupt the cycle of violence. 

As an effective alternative to police we need to see these programs in all of our neighborhoods.

While 3 people were recommended for freedom last week it’s indefensible that the Board of Pardons continues to shut down second chances for many who are rehabilitated and often have the recommendation of the Department of Corrections and the DA’s office. 

https://t.co/o3tVddssGX
Around 3pm, we’ll start live tweeting the Board of Pardons hearings. Six people serving life or long term sentences will be heard by the Board, who will have the opportunity to support second chances by voting to recommend rehabilitated people for clemency.
Take action with us. 

This week the Board of Pardons meets to consider the cases of a number of people serving life and longterm sentences. TOMORROW at 6 PM join us to call on them to free people who have turned around their lives. Register here: https://t.co/qkeK23GNT4.

Today @PHLCouncil will likely vote to pass @PHLMayor budget out of committee. We call on council and the mayor to shift funding for co-responders to mobile crisis teams so Philadelphians can call 911 for mental health crises without fear of bringing an armed cop to the scene.
Life without parole disregards people's capacity for redemption and robs resources from our communities. We're building a movement to abolish it with powerful partners like @TowardAbolition @AbolitionistLC @aclupa @FAMMFoundation @DecarceratePA and #CADBI. Together we will win!

What do you think our communities need to be safe? We worked with our allies @mvmalliance @vietlead @Phillybailout @PAWorkFamilies @Vamos_Juntos_ and @reclaimphila to ask over 1,300 Philadelphians that question. 

Find out what they told us:

Interesting article from @Will_Bunch. Would we be safer if we replaced police with a civilian run Department of Community Solutions and Public Safety? 

With Philly police clearing just 50% of homicides we think so. We must tackle root causes of violence.

Great reporting by @cherrigregg:

“Kris Henderson of @AmistadLaw says too many have gotten a death sentence because of the governor’s inaction. "People like Bruce Norris, who, after over 40 years...was waiting for the governor’s signature to come home."

In this article @Sentinel_Vaughn reveals that bloated police budgets don’t keep us safe. Currently the homicide clearance rate is just around 50%. 

We need to invest in liberatory community based anti-violence programs like @YEAHPhilly not police.

Predictably @CorrectionsPA is delaying the new dashboard which was promised after we and others revealed they mismanaged data reporting infections. In the meantime all the public has access to is an irregularly updated PDF that contains no data on how many tests they are doing.
After we exposed mismanagement of COVID testing data in PA prisons by @CorrectionsPA they committed to create a new data dashboard. 

On Monday we’ll be at the deadline they set and it’s important we raise three things the public needs for transparency and accountability.

And we are still waiting for a full and transparent accounting of all the errors with data tracking COVID infections among incarcerated people in PA state prisons @CorrectionsPA. Behind every number is a human life, someone’s loved one. https://t.co/v84P5bMZLA

Prisons across Pennsylvania count how many incarcerated people are present many times a day. If the count is off everything stops. However, that same level of care has not applied to counting incarcerated people sick with COVID-19. @CorrectionsPA has wildly mismanaged the data.
Advocates and journalists have been pressing @CorrectionsPA on wild discrepancies in data reporting COVID infections among people under their care. How does their head data guy  respond? With a flippant ‘happy holidays’. Unacceptable @kbucklen. We need full data transparency. https://t.co/AR89FcjNIb
In the fall alone nearly five times as many incarcerated people have DIED from COVID-19 compared to the number that perished in the spring and summer COMBINED. The DOC never had control of the pandemic in PA prisons. It just hadn’t arrived in them yet.
