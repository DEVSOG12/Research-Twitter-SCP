We are relieved that President Biden rescinded the Muslim and African Bans. That this was a Day 1 priority was a hard-won victory by impacted communities, after years of devastating harm caused by a ban that was first announced as Trump's primary campaign promise.
This is a coup produced by white nationalist forces nourished by the right for decades and fully operationalized by a lawless, racist president.
