ICYMI: Cast joined @MORERadioNetwor and @BetTzedek's Matt DeCarolis to discuss #AB625, a bill that provides lost income for #humantrafficking victims. Watch here: https://t.co/S7VHjvnUYB
The pandemic is back on the rise and so is the demand for Cast‚Äôs services, with a 270% increase since March. With fewer places for #humantrafficking victims to escape, Cast transitioned its emergency shelter to a hotel, serving 50% more survivors. (1/3)
Meet #trafficking survivor and Cast graduate, Angela. Angela came to the U.S. on a legal visa, but her trafficker tricked her into #forcedlabor.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ 
‚ÄØ 
She worked 18‚ÄØhr‚ÄØdays, slept on the floor in a hallway, and ate table‚ÄØscraps.

Survivors of #HumanTrafficking are entitled to #VictimsRights Protections. In many states, these rights are constitutional. Many survivors are never offered attorneys to help them enforce these rights. 100% of @CASTLA clients are offered Victims' Rights representation.

On Tuesday, #AB629 passed out of committee! We are one step closer to creating economic stability for #humantrafficking #survivors. We must give them the ability to collect back wages for time they were trafficked. It‚Äôs life changing. Thank you bill author @Christyfor38.

This thread from @EYAlbright is a reminder to be careful during the #SuperBowl .  Be wary of headlines that say that #humantrafficking  increases during this time. The data says otherwise. Avoid creating hysteria that can put people at more risk. https://t.co/uaQ3KkzzsF
1/ @CASTLA attorneys provide #VictimsRights support to survivors who access our legal services. In 2018, CAST attorneys assisted to have $2.4M in restitution ordered.  Restitution is an extremely underutilized form of legal relief for survivors of #humantrafficking. https://t.co/f0MFU8O9C4
