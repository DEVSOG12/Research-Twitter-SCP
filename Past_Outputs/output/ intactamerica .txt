Intact penises come with their own lubrication. Cut a baby boy, and he will lose the natural moisture between the foreskin and the glans (head of the penis). Sadly, he and his partners will be buying lube all his adult life. #fridayforeskinfacts #circumcision #sex https://t.co/kWzLrAJ1dI

Without a foreskin, the glans, or head of the #penis, lacks protection. Exposure to urine and feces in diapers, and chafing from clothing over time, cause the glans to dry out, become tougher and lose sensitivity. Help us protect babies from #circumcision! #FridayForeskinFacts https://t.co/VG5fwlkrcG

On #NationalParentsDay, we honor the parents who protect their sons from the pain and loss of their foreskin AND parents who now understand it is wrong to cut baby boys. Thank you for stopping the #circumcision cycle! #sons https://t.co/FIleQRDvIp
Please RT: Foreskins are like eyelids. They protect vital body parts from irritants and from drying out. So why does the America medical system cut foreskins off baby boys? #fridayforeskinfacts #circumcision https://t.co/3KXJLJYdFt

Whether it’s your partner or yourself, caressing a penis is easier if it has a foreskin! The foreskin’s gliding action and natural lubrication is ideal for pleasurable stroking without friction. #circumcision #masturbation https://t.co/AaU5D5hFsi

Let's call it what it is: male child #genital cutting (MCGC, a.k.a. #circumcision). MCGC of #baby boys is widespread in America, despite evidence of real harm to boys and the men they will become. We're seeking to end MCGC in America. Join us! https://t.co/FoDHZUlDuE https://t.co/hCso5VCLyf
The media in general tend to downplay the risk and harm of cutting a #baby boy's #genitals. So, it's worth reminding everybody of a 2015 article in @PsychToday that attests to the psychological damage caused by this painful, unnecessary surgery. https://t.co/XxvLH9sC3o https://t.co/dr2ybx9KGQ

Asking parents (not the patient) if they want to circumcise their son and then asking again and again, is called SOLICITATION. It is considered HIGHLY UNETHICAL.
