‚ÄúWhat Lutfi bin Ali's story demonstrates however, is that the government's goal was not to responsibly reduce the detainee population, but to responsibly dispose of these inconvenient men".

Please read @Dr_Maha_Hilal's critical account of the War on Terror and the deeply embedded institutionalized #Islamophobia that has led to the targeting and dehumanization of #Muslims. https://t.co/CmtuF8poHI
.@Dr_Maha_Hilal &amp; @TasnimMotala discuss the subgroup of Muslims who rely on respectability politics. Those for whom it's not about improving the conditions of Muslims, but proximity to power &amp; participating in the oppression of their community members.

#InnocentUntilProvenMuslim
.@Dr_Maha_Hilal and @TasnimMotala discuss how we need to grapple with the root causes of the War on Terror. Bush said that history started after 9/11. This does not take into account US imperialism, and it constructs the US as the perpetual victim.

#InnocentUntilProvenMuslim
What is Internalized Islamophobia?

@Dr_Maha_Hilal explains that one example is the frequent rush by some Muslims &amp; Muslim organizations to condemn acts of violence perpetrated by Muslims, while at the same time denying Muslim victimhood.

#InnocentUntilProvenMuslim
.@Dr_Maha_Hilal: There's a sign in the CIA that says, "Everyday is September 12th." What is this sign trying to convey? That the US is always under threat, and is always the target and the victim. Never the perpetrator.

#CloseGuantanamo
"We are in this fight together. This is a fight to abolish the War on Terror, to abolish the prison industrial complex. That begins with shutting down detention centers and shutting down Guant√°namo. They have the power to do it, and we have to hold them to it." - @silkys13

"I come as a form of accountability for the involvement I had [at Guant√°namo Bay]. I come in an attempt to do what I can to work toward repairing the harms in which I was involved. In doing so, I recognize I can never undo the past. But I can work for change." - Daniel Lakemacher
