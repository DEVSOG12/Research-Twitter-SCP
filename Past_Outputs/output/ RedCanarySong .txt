This Filipinx sister reached out to us because of the way she was treated by @AF3IRM.

She read our writing about this SWERF org that speaks over sex workers, as metaphors for degradation, rather than as complex human beings. 

She asked us to amplify her thread. Please RT: https://t.co/3dqkiVqvvr

Received DM objecting to our alluding to ÈªëÂëΩË¥µ tweets, bc there are a lot of trolls &amp; bots, and we shouldn't be giving that more attention.

Deleted. 

However, fighting these troll-farms &amp; right wing propoganda on WeChat is part of the problem. People legit adopt these views.
One problem is WeChat, a Chinese Communist Party owned platform, which has been nonstop pushing right-wing media, Trump support, and straight up LIES and feeding anti-black racism.

THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM. THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM. 

Why is the CCP sowing this discord in the U.S.?

One important point to highlight:

You can‚Äôt have a universal housing guarantee without full sex work decrim.

Under current ‚Äúpimp‚Äù laws, landlords are charged as pimps. This allows for legal housing discrimination against sex workers, requiring workers to live and work in fear.

Thank you, AM Kim @rontkim and Niou @yuhline for taking the political risks to stand up for your constituents.

You listen, you care, and you fight for people who are repeatedly stigmatized and invisibilized. You take the attacks with us.

This is the leadership our city needs. https://t.co/y8Bn4kedcU

Police sexual misconduct, rape, theft.

‚ÄúThese arrests...came from one task force: Human Trafficking Unit. (In first 10 weeks of 2019, charged almost as many people as all of 2016.)‚Äù But only 4 trafficking arrests.

Silence of well-funded antitrafficking orgs here speaks volumes. https://t.co/YlRcTx77SY
