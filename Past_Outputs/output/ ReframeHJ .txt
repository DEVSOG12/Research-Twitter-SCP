Every year, we continue to break record high overdose rates in D.C. In 2021, we lost nearly 600 ppl to overdose. 86% of these deaths were of Black Washingtonians. This is a racial justice issue, as much as it is a public health issue

Criminalizing desired products/ services is ineffective &amp; harmful. The idea that restricting the supply side of this problem has positive impacts on the demand side is contrary to basic economic principles ‚Äì demand drives supply, not the other way around.

Drugs have been used to criminalize Black &amp; Brown D.C. residents &amp; people experiencing poverty instead of addressing the root causes of serious social &amp; public health issues. Enough is enough.

DC is facing a crisis. In 2020, the District saw the highest OD rates on record + there are scarce health services for those who need them the most. Tell DC Council: decrim drugs and invest in health services in DC
