Pornhub doesn't verify age or consent of those in their videos. When illegal content is publicized they say they use an "extensive team" of moderators to review all uploads. But how can a moderator tell the difference between an 18yo &amp; a 16yo? They can't. https://t.co/21gjGXNKhP https://t.co/67oXekQ61r
Another trafficker recorded himself abusing a 16-yo girl, uploaded it to Pornhub, &amp; got earnings on it for 2 years. Since Pornhub verified the trafficker via their Modelhub program they split profits 35/65. He's now facing charges of producing child porn https://t.co/T3Ge1iw8Gx
