"It is incredibly frustrating to see survivors' stories weaponized to keep wealth-based incarceration in place, especially considering that survivor advocates like us helped write this policy to end it."

One of our most exciting moments in 2021 was the city's budget announcement. The $35 million allocated to address gender-based violence is a monumental investment, but we know our work is just beginning. Onward! #10DaysOfCAASE https://t.co/eMBIi1VHrf https://t.co/U7K7ZboQCf
In 2021, CAASE's Policy team made waves in the national media. We were recognized as an expert voice on important issues, and we were pleased to speak with major outlets like @MotherJones us get the word out in the new year with a donation today: https://t.co/aKFTEk3t5A https://t.co/XeDI3XV9YP
Our #10DaysOfCAASE countdown continues with a highlight from our legal team. As survivors seek accountability, they might consider getting a protective order. While it sounds self-explanatory, the process can be complicated—Here's how to begin:

This year, CAASE took a stand to #EndCashBail: "Policies rooted in fear-mongering and racism...continue to push an agenda that perpetuates a criminal legal system that fails victims and disproportionately harms Black and brown communities." #CAASEInTheNews https://t.co/SQyx8gTVI7

This year, we had the chance to speak about the realities of housing for sex offenders: "The goal is to open up more housing for folks...We know that poverty, housing issues, other things are more likely to lead to crime." https://t.co/5paKsfgqZT #CAASEInTheNews

As we reflect on our biggest stories of 2021, we're so pleased that IL took the steps to #EndCashBail: "Judges will make determinations about whether someone is a risk to flee or is a threat...This is especially significant for domestic violence cases." https://t.co/V6h9BRddHq

Strategy is key when it comes to ending #GenderBasedViolence. A collaboration between activists and local government, the Citywide Strategic Plan to Address Gender-Based Violence and Human Trafficking maps the infrastructure @chicago survivors need. #ThisIsWhatSafetyLooksLike https://t.co/RWCirCj3at

Here in Chicago, #RKelly's fame and fandom reached its peak. So did his abuse. If you are wondering why he was tried in New York, or have questions about the charges, check out this piece from @jmetr22b. https://t.co/sSCk55qnop

#RKelly was found guilty on all counts—including sexual exploitation of a child, bribery, kidnapping, racketeering &amp; sex trafficking. This is especially significant because Black girls &amp; women are at greater risk of sexual harm yet their voices have largely been left unheard. https://t.co/qoVY1HhIPg

Gabby Petito's murder isn't a singular moment. More than 1/2 of female homicide victims in the US are killed by their current or former partners. Moreover, the body cam footage shows how ineffective policing is in the face of this gender-based violence. https://t.co/Q8T1IYeeZL

We're thrilled to see that @chicagosmayor has proposed a budget that provides critical support for legal services for survivors of domestic and sexual violence. We’re excited to fight for this vital investment, because we know how much survivors rely on these groups. #ChiBudget22 https://t.co/yfO2AAJcEU
A reminder that funding work—including artwork—prevents sexual coercion and mitigates involvement in the sex trade. #ChiBudget22
How will @chicago's 2022 budget address the urgent needs of survivors? Will we see funding that confronts the realities of gender-based violence? Join us here at 10AM while we live-tweet the @chicagosmayor's announcement.  #ChiBudget22 https://t.co/u0bVoxQEm5
The Department of Education does not plan to propose a new Title IX rule until 5/22. The stakes are too dire for this slow action. That's precisely why CAASE signed onto a letter from @nwlc that advocates for more urgent engagement:

When survivors share their experiences it can be traumatic, but it can also be empowering to reclaim their story. Never push people to share but listen compassionately when survivors want to open up. This can help with the journey of healing.

The Department of Education finalized Title IX rule changes DURING A PANDEMIC — It feels like a gut punch, but let's remember the rule isn't final just yet. CAASE will continue to analyze the change and fight like hell to defend survivors' rights. #HandsOffIX https://t.co/SyFgvHloxK

We're in a new era of #remotelearning, and with that comes a period of enormous transition. CAASE has responded by making our #preventioneducation materials accessible online, enabling conversations about #consent and more to take place at home.

#TBT: We sure miss gathering to protest — Here’s a #FightFor15 rally from last August, right in the middle of downtown Chicago. #COVID continues to show the importance of #fairwages and we’ll continue the fight long after #quarantine ends! https://t.co/fJ3n8kpFkX

Anxiously anticipated #TitleIX rule changes that roll back survivors' rights were finalized. Wondering "Now what?"

1. They are not in effect yet! Survivor allies, including @theCAASE, are fighting to make sure they never will be. 

#HandsOffIX
The new Title IX rule was finalized today. It rolls back the rights of survivors and will make schools more dangerous. But it hasn't gone into effect yet! CAASE and our allies will fight to make sure it never does. #HandsOffIX https://t.co/rgIJUXHHiv
Reports of #DomesticViolence in three cities have dropped during #COVID — Is this a positive sign or a harmful repercussion of the stay-at-home order? Great analysis from @MarshallProj!

We need the #FairTaxNow. A taxation plan that reduces taxes for 90+% of us and raises taxes on 3% seems pretty good right now.

Absolutely the right decision. 

ISP should not focus on drug testing right now. Divert all resources to COVID-19 testing. Then divert them all to rape kit backlog. Only after that should there be drug testing at ISP. https://t.co/MekGsZT7Oa
