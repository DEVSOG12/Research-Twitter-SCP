Racism in legal systems, and other aspects of American life, leads to immense disparities in the IL prison population. Elected officials have constructed definitions of crime to entrap Black communities &amp; legislated harsher punishments for Black people. https://t.co/sXHy9byiyy https://t.co/03RrXqg3SM

What is Wednesday: Mandatory Minimums. A mandatory minimum gives judges a mandatory length of time for which they must sentence someone - depending on the felony class.

We need sentences that allow our children to be rehabilitated. But, authorities in Lake County are charging these 5 teens with murder. We should instead seek other pathways to accountability. Join us in pushing for more just laws. #LakeCountyFive https://t.co/OUf4n5oKms

Please call Lake County State’s Attorney Michael Nerheim &amp; ask him to drop charges against the #LakeCountyFive as he has the power to do, so they can grieve w/ loved ones &amp; benefit from supportive services over incarceration.

Felony murder &amp; laws &amp; legal theories of accountability, allow for prosecutors to make charging decisions that offer longer sentences. Prosecutors defend these laws as a deterrent, rather than a continuation of violence. #LakeCountyFive https://t.co/wc03HYobIr

Theories of accountability, including felony murder or failure to protect, hold ppl, often abuse survivors, accountable for outcomes they could not control or predict. They identify survivors as a proximate cause of violence for which they are also victims. #AbolishFelonyMurder

"The situation here is a shocking example of the potential absurdity of this law, as broad as any such statute in the nation, according to research overseen by @SDrizin." Read this column from @EricZorn @chicagotribune. #Twill #FelonyMurder #LakeCounty https://t.co/PzSLwpAPEJ

The felony-murder law "has long been criticized as an overreach. England abolished it years ago, as have several other countries and states." Read more about Illinois' archaic &amp; overly broad statute in this @RobertMcCoppin story. #Twill #FelonyMurder https://t.co/xrDMo4A3TQ
Children can change. Rehabilitation is possible. But, #LakeCounty officials are charging 5 teens with murder through the felony-murder law. This is an inappropriate use of an archaic law.

We know enough about the youthful brain &amp; the impact of life/de facto life sentences to know these charges are excessive, expensive, &amp; bad for our communities. Join us in pushing for laws that acknowledge kids can change. #Twill #FelonyMurder https://t.co/i8BAR6G63p

Illinois has 1 of the broadest felony-murder statutes in the country. Children &amp; young adults can be convicted of 1st-degree murder even if they did not actually kill the victim or intend to commit the murder. Read Masonique's story, which happened in Ohio https://t.co/uaYK5K1p9k

So glad to have spent this morning discussing justice and compassion with the great @helenprejean! It was such and honor to hear her story and share our own. She such an inspiration in the fight for reform! https://t.co/HHp5m33mfY
State level is where the majority of reforms will have to take place to end mass incarceration. This report from @ACLU does a great job of showing how we can do just that. (And always glad to see folks unafraid of addressing the need to reform sentencing for violent offenses!) https://t.co/b4J4tOiFUF

It's Labor Day and inmates around the US are on strike. Many Illinois prisoners, however, have no work to begin with. https://t.co/MGVhvNNByK

Jobs are a source of power &amp; meaning; may all have access to them.
 
Labor is a valuable resource; may all be compensated fairly for it. https://t.co/0S558XqA5J
