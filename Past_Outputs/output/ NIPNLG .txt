Under @POTUS, the cutting of detention contracts has meant the transfer of people to other detention centers instead of their release. This is unacceptable. As detention centers shut down, people must be released rather than transferred or deported, fullstop. #CommunitiesNotCages
The continued deportation flights to Haiti - 204 flights by @POTUS totaling over 20,000 people in a year since he took office - must be immediately stopped &amp; people seeking safety at our borders must be granted their legally assured chance to seek asylum. #CommunitiesNotCages

Across the country, communities are organizing to dismantle the jail-to-deportation pipeline created by #IIRIRA, tens of thousands have been deported.

At the federal level, Congress has yet to fully address the harms caused by this horrendous law. It‚Äôs time to repeal #IIRIRA!
In 1996, Congress passed #IIRIRA, an anti-immigrant law that made detention and deportation a mandatory minimum. Since then, immigrant detention and deportations have skyrocketed and the jail-to-deportation pipeline continues to harm our communities.

#IIRIRA, signed by Pres. Clinton in 1996, dramatically expanded grounds for deportation, including for legal permanent residents. The law also strengthened collaboration between ICE &amp; police that funnel people into detention.
