Over a year ago we fought to protect over 10,000 homeless NYers from COVID-19 by demanding hotel rooms for everyone.

Now NYC is threatening to move everybody back to crowded shelters.

The men at the Williams Hotel in Brooklyn are fighting back and demand #HotelsToHousing. https://t.co/JZOI5BCQtg

The legislature has 6 DAYS LEFT to take action on homelessness, syringe expansion &amp; decriminalization, and parole reform. @CarlHeastie &amp; @AndreaSCousins, will you keep your promises to NYers in crisis? 

Take action! Demand leaders pass 4 critical bills: https://t.co/omBwLYSU0z https://t.co/HPtiGurtey

Every 5 hours, a NYer dies from a preventable overdose. 

We know what prevents these deaths: overdose prevention centers, universal access to harm reduction services &amp; healthcare, total decriminalization of drugs &amp; a safe supply.

Let's talk about it. NYC spends over $14 billion on policing, courts, and jails. This brings more harm to Black and brown communities and is proven to be totally ineffective at addressing record homelessness, overdose deaths, and unmet mental health needs! https://t.co/fTiIrDjb1r
