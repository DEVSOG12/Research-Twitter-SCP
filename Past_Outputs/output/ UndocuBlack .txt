March 20th marks the shameful 2nd anniversary of the Title 42 policy, under which over ONE  MILLION  migrants and asylum seekers have been summarily expelled to danger, without the opportunity to seek safety in the United States. #EndTitle42 https://t.co/saiGk0dk7X
Operation Lone Star is Texas Governor Greg Abbott's latest attempt to attack and criminalize migrants and people of color. Through this racist, unlawful, and xenophobic program, Texas law enforcement officers target migrants for criminal prosecution. #EndOpLoneStar https://t.co/PwobVnpgVR

Op. Lone Star fuels the flames of racist, anti-immigrant sentiment in Texas and threatens to embolden states along the border to initiate similar discriminatory programs.

Laws like #IIRIRA, signed by Pres. Clinton 25 yrs ago, created the mass detention &amp; deportation system we have today. This law made it possible for local police to serve as ICE agents, expanded the grounds for deportation, and eliminated due process for many immigrants.
