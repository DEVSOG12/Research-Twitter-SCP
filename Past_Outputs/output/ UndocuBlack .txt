In 1996, Congress passed #IIRIRA, an anti-immigrant law that made detention and deportation a mandatory minimum. Since then, immigrant detention and deportations have skyrocketed and the jail-to-deportation pipeline continues to harm our communities.

Laws like #IIRIRA, signed by Pres. Clinton 25 yrs ago, created the mass detention &amp; deportation system we have today. This law made it possible for local police to serve as ICE agents, expanded the grounds for deportation, and eliminated due process for many immigrants.
