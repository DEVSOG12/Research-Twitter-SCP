This move is not safe for these children.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that sentencing children to life without the possibility of parole is unconstitutional in all but the rarest of cases.  Children have an amazing ability to change, and placing them in adult courtrooms, and jails is not the solution. https://t.co/voXWMvUcvN
