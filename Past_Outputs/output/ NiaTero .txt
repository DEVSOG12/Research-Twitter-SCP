#Indigenous relationships with land show us how #Reciprocity is not just about a mutual obligation to protect each other, but also establishes true equality, equal importance, and interdependence needed to thrive.

A story of the #Land is a story of its people! #NiaTeroCommunity https://t.co/I91GqdcZNL

Acknowledging #Land as a relative with personhood demonstrates the importance of family as being more than human people, but inclusive of all kinds of plant, animal, and minerals, who contribute together towards the greater whole. #ReciprocityWithAllBeings #NiaTeroCommunity

#MutualAid is an act of solidarity! #Solidarity acknowledges the broad spectrum of lived experience. It means we don’t need to have witnessed or lived through the same thing as someone else in order to support them in what they're going through. #NiaTeroCommunity https://t.co/dyaUpwSOHc
Mutual aid is the sharing of resources between a group of people with no need of 1:1 exchange, reimbursement, or receipt. Our life situations are always in flux &amp; #MutualAid is less about “gifting” &amp; more about keeping a community cared for through #Reciprocity. #NiaTeroCommunity
"I am where I am today, it is because I refuse to be what they told me I was. I refused to feel inferior."

Juniper trees are known for the berrylike cones that sprout off their leaves. Seen as a sign of protection, they are often carried on long journeys. #Juniper has strong plant medicine &amp; is used across many cultures to banish away evil spirits or to protect the home in winter. 🌳 https://t.co/AWKv4pBKBk
