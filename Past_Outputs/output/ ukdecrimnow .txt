What happens when your benefits get sanctioned, and you’re left with almost no money to pay your bills or feed your children? Some women resort to sex work in order to survive &amp; to support their families - but the law puts them in more danger. Watch the video to find out more 👇 https://t.co/MwmKQ4gZKN
🚨New video from @HAHcampaign 🚨- benefits sanctions push more women into sex work, and the law makes the work more dangerous. Help us to support sex workers in crisis and lobby the government to provide more support - follow @HAHcampaign for more info 💪☂️ https://t.co/MwmKQ4gZKN

The Observer have refused to publish a letter we submitted to them on November 25th in response to Sonia Sodha‘s dangerous article promoting the criminalisation of clients (the Nordic model). @NewSocialistUK have kindly published the letter for us: https://t.co/7RLbPxcZku
Time and time again our arguments for decriminalisation are misrepresented as “sex work is empowering!”. Selling sexual labour is a means of survival not empowerment. And it’s often a dangerous one. Criminalisation makes it more dangerous.

More news! Just found out that @UNISONLGBT passed a motion in support of full decrim of sex work back in November. We hope we can work with them to get UNISON to adopt this as policy.

It’s likely that the decriminalisation of sex work motion won’t be heard at #UNDC19 . If any members want us to come to speak to their branch about why UNISON’s policy needs to change, please DM us or contact us through our website.

If you are attending #uNDC19 today please support workers who are asking for rights! Some UNISON members will also be sex workers, please don’t leave your colleagues vulnerable at work. UNISON recommends working in pairs but sex workers are criminalised for doing this.

This is a very flawed study and also legalisation isn’t decrim. @DrEllaC can take it apart but I recommend reading the conclusion of the study which clearly says “there is no smoking gun” #rcn19 https://t.co/Ty3bDkEyPB

It’s always fun to have discussions with whorephobes who think sex workers never have HMRC issues or pay tax when we have all had experience helping workers navigate the self assessment system and the benefit system.
