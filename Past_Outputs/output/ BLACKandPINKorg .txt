LGBTQ+ youth have greater barriers to face than their peers. They shouldn’t be housing insecure due to how they identify or because of who they love. We’ve gotta build systems that protect these babies.
November is National Homeless Youth Awareness Month. While we know all youth deserve housing. LGBTQ+ have a staggeringly higher number of housing insecurity than their peers. This is why building safe, supportive and inclusive housing is so important. https://t.co/WuMhL5uFC0

Police cause more harm than good. They don’t do anything but uphold white supremacy and police Black &amp; Brown bodies. We good on that.
We don’t need police in schools. We need more social workers and teachers who are equipped to handle crisis.
Electric monitors for folks coming home is another way to keep folks incarcerated and isolated. But y’all not ready for that conversation.
Cops don’t belong in schools. Let’s get them out of there. They just cause more harm and anxiety to our Black and Brown kids.

We are punishing our youth after we failed them. We as in this country. This justice system was never built to restore youth but further break them down. The same can be said for the broken foster care system.
