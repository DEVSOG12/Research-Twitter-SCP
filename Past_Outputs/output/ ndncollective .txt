Relatives check out this Red Nation pod episode featuring NDN's #LANDBACK Campaign Director Krystal Two Bulls @KrystalRain8, an Indigenous anti-war veteran with a rad decolonial perspective about the military industrial complex. These are the transformative conversations we need! https://t.co/iFcmTso4T7
This is why we work to invest and resource our people and communities. Today, as we lean into the uncertainty, we remain strong and steadfast in our mission to equip Indigenous Peoples with the tools they need to be the architects of their future.

Today is Election Day, Fam! Today we put down our tobacco. We burn our sage and we pray and call in the future that our people so deserve.  #defenddevelopdecolonize https://t.co/GQU8Amb2G8
When it comes to the #NativeVote we can thank Indigenous women for ensuring our right to vote. Decades later, women are carrying on that legacy to build Indigenous political power.
