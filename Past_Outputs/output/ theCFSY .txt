Banning life without parole sentences for crimes committed in childhood is safe and effective. In the three states that have released the most people serving JLWOP following the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in Montgomery v. Louisiana, the recidivism rate is less than 2%. #MontgomeryAt5 https://t.co/iIlDV1EhEX

Washington state Supreme Court rules juvenile life sentence without parole is unconstitutional ||coverage from @theHill

We had a wonderful day at the #HirePhillyOct4 job fair, which connects employers with job seekers, including formerly incarcerated children. While there we connected with other advocates, like rapper @MeekMill, who is doing incredible work in the criminal justice reform space. https://t.co/4S3yZYBXhn

We're thrilled that #CA @JerryBrownGov signed SB 1391 into law, which prohibits the prosecution of 14 and 15 year olds as adults in California.

"There is a fundamental principle at stake here..."

We hope @JerryBrownGov makes the right choice and signs #SB1391 into law this week -- 14- and 15-year-old children should never be sentenced as adults https://t.co/pvmvYLVq4y

"I do not think that a sentence to life without ever having the opportunity to be considered for parole or the hope of ever being released from prison is appropriate for juveniles. As noted in the #SCOTUS decision, children really are 'different.'" https://t.co/Q6EoZB1PzL

Very important piece in @TheAtlantic by @JoshRovner. "Maybe Kavanaugh‚Äôs allies should take this moment to ask themselves if youthful offenders in general deserve more leniency."
The #SmartSafeFair report finds that to truly reduce youth violence, recidivism, mass incarceration and racial disparities, we must stop preventing young people involved in violent crime from being effectively treated in the community https://t.co/AYfmWNTJaX
