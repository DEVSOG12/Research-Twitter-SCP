The federal stimulus package includes $850M to local and state jails, prisons and law enforcement. Increased policing and incarceration will quickly spread the virus in the most vulnerable communities.

It is time to decarcerate.

COVID-19 is continuing to spread in NYC jails. People who are currently incarcerated need us to amplify their demands for testing, hygiene products, + devices to remain in contact with their families.

At the same time, we must demand that @nycmayor #FreeThemAll4PublicHealth.

Rob Kampia said, “In the aftermath of the accusations against him, he said, he concluded sex workers would be less likely to “blab” about their encounters than those who are not paid for the intimate contact.” https://t.co/xlXkf3zkWE
This is not true. If every infraction was enforced, everyone would be in jail. Also, this ignores the fact that police violate the law and often times work together to violate the law, such as when police retaliate against spouses for reporting domestic violence by an officer https://t.co/xv5J7n4jdf

It’s not new information that criminalization acts as a barrier to resources for young people who experience violence while trading sex.

Training to “spot” trafficking does nothing to address the conditions that lead to trafficking. Instead, it often perpetuates racial profiling.
