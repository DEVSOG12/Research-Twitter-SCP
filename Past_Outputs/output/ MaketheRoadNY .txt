Over a dozen NYers arrested in front of @GovKathyHochul’s office. 

For the past two years, tenants have suffered without any permanent protections.

Thousands of NY tenants risk losing their homes.

@GovKathyHochul, it’s time to pass #GoodCause and #HouseNY to make sure they’re protected. https://t.co/QSN4qro9Bb
