‚òïÔ∏è Good morning from the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas. 

It‚Äôs a beautiful day to fight for abortion access. 

Follow this thread for updates on today‚Äôs hearing for a preliminary injunction on Ohio‚Äôs six week abortion ban! 

üßµ‚öñÔ∏èüßµ https://t.co/2HGajx1pen
üö®Tomorrow at 9am our attorneys will be at the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas fighting to keep the 6week abortion ban blocked for the duration of our case.

If granted, this would mean *significant*, extended relief for Ohioans.

We will never stop fighting for our rights.
Ohio anti-abortion politicians will stop at nothing to strip away our reproductive rights. 

Not on our watch.

In Ohio, the death penalty is arbitrarily applied based on race and place. 

You can see that the geographic disparity is largely due to the available financial resources of the county and personal views of the prosecuting attorney. #NoDeathPenaltyOH

Cash bail does not keep us safe. 

Proponents of State Issue 1 are intentionally trying to blur the lines with divisive rhetoric about public safety. State Issue 1 is NOT bail reform as we know it or need it.

In the days following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe, we surveyed voters across the state. 

This polling confirms what we have seen, heard, and lived for decades: a strong majority (82%) of Ohioans support some form of abortion access.

The executive order is very welcome. We‚Äôre thrilled to see further commitment by the president to help protect access to essential health care.  In Ohio, we must pledge to elect lawmakers who will restore abortion rights.
