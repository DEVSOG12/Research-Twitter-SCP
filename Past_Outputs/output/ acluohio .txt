In Ohio, the death penalty is arbitrarily applied based on race and place. 

You can see that the geographic disparity is largely due to the available financial resources of the county and personal views of the prosecuting attorney. #NoDeathPenaltyOH

Cash bail does not keep us safe. 

Proponents of State Issue 1 are intentionally trying to blur the lines with divisive rhetoric about public safety. State Issue 1 is NOT bail reform as we know it or need it.

The color of a defendant and victim's skin plays a crucial and unacceptable role in deciding who receives the death penalty in America. People of color have accounted for a disproportionate 43% of total executions since 1976.

The more a district is gerrymandered, the less those who represent it need to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters in general elections; they’re only concern is winning their primaries.

Partisan gerrymandering increases political polarization.

New piece by A.J. Wagner, retired Montgomery County Common Pleas Court judge. 👇

"Justice isn’t just when it is random or unevenly applied. Justice requires passage of House Bill 183 and Senate Bill 103."

In 2011, Ohio map makers drew legislative districts under the cover of darkness in the now infamous “bunker;” a hotel room adjacent to the Statehouse to skirt public records &amp; open meetings laws. 

#FairMaps come from a fair process. We demand both. ✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿

Ohio officials will soon be drawing new maps to determine what district we live in, who represents us, and how to allocate resources for our communities for the next decade. We must join together now to advocate for fair districts. @OhFairDistricts

Improper redistricting practices — like prison gerrymandering — can result in unequal representation in voting districts, under representing many communities, especially communities of color. https://t.co/F6GB63NQsQ
Preventing trans youth from accessing gender affirming care won't stop trans youth from being trans. It will only prevent some trans youth from growing up at all.
