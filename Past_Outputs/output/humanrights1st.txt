We've said it once. We'll say it a thousand times more: Death and disaster don't respond to changes in U.S. policy. 

Refugees fleeing for their lives still see the U.S. as a beacon of hope and safety. Let's live up to that legacy.

#NEW:  As the Biden admin ramps up its expulsion of Haitians &amp; makes arbitrary distinctions between groups fleeing persecution and danger, Human Rights First urged them to end Title 42 and restart asylum.

The @POTUS &amp; Biden admin are sending planes full of children, families, and adults seeking protection to danger in Haiti under Title 42, including children under the age of three. #StopDeportationFlightsNow

@POTUS: Do the right thing and end Title 42 completely. https://t.co/zHbyUmVFJ1
