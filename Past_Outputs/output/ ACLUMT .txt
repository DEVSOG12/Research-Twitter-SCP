Keep the phones ringing! 📞The BIA plans to reopen the #TwoRivers Detention Facility. This prison would only be used to hold incarcerated Native Americans. The decision to reopen #TwoRivers has been quietly pushed forward by the gvt w/o input from affected tribal communities. https://t.co/1IlJ5pU1JN
Happy New Year, Montana! We look forward to a new year organizing, advocating, and resisting with you! https://t.co/MmjBTJH7Sf
2/3 To justify the expense of this facility, the city of Hardin wants the BIA to fill the 464 beds with tribal members.For Indigenous Montanans, this strengthens the hold that the federal gvt has over tribal people and incentives the BIA to arrest tribal members at a higher rate. https://t.co/pWx75yCNi1
The state should not give itself the right to kill human beings – especially when it kills with premeditation and ceremony, in the name of the law or in the name of its people, and when it does so in an arbitrary &amp; discriminatory fashion. #mtnews https://t.co/fB2sH3soAM

Tell them: 1)Collaborating with ICE to enforce inhumane immigration laws, and at the expense of local resources, degrades what it means to be a Montanan. By using your authority and doing so willingly, you are propping up a racist immigration system. https://t.co/MMJ4mCMqba

Dear #mtleg, this spring, MT showed our commitment to criminal justice reform. Do not be bought by @CoreCivic. Reject this for-profit cash kickback that further entrenches @CoreCivic in MT's criminal justice system &amp; lines the TN corporation's pockets.

"The $30 million we have saved in that account is the $30 million that CoreCivic is 'willing to contribute' to the state. Their price for giving us our money back?
