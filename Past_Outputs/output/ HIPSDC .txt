So thrilled to see Rhode Island pioneering interventions that we know work to save lives. The U.S. is so far behind in enacting real #harmreduction -based policy, but this is a huge step in the right direction. Can't wait for the day when we can see this in DC! #DecrimPovertyDC https://t.co/OqW2xAXCo0

"When people are passed out, on drugs, strung out, there needs to be someplace to take them besides the hospital." Sounds like this piece of human garbage supports safe consumption spaces, at least. Wild how similar bars are to that concept, @ExileBrewingCo https://t.co/rGoRCzCXIC

In addition to providing terrible guidance around an ongoing pandemic, Dr. Wen touts harm reduction half-measures while calling this overdose emergency driven by a contaminated drug supply an ‚Äòopioid crisis.‚Äô In 2022. Do not take your public health advice from her. https://t.co/ORyKRXmWH8
Thank you for doing this, but just to be clear harm reduction does not require recovery as an end goal. It‚Äôs a strategy, but it‚Äôs also a movement rooted in mutual aid that encompasses the harms caused by the War on Drugs and recognizes PWUD as experts of their own lives. https://t.co/oYz2F9NsPE

Those experiences are real but why do we play into the gateway theory at all? We know ‚Äògateway drugs‚Äô don‚Äôt exist, and social factors are way too complex to tack to a list. The premise of this question implies that drug use = inherently bad/harmful. https://t.co/IlguReWguS
üßµ and: we also know that the contaminated drug supply will continue even in an age of decriminalization, especially if it‚Äôs only applied to local municipalities. Decriminalization is vital but Prohibition is at the root of why we‚Äôre in this national emergency. https://t.co/AmsyyxZU6b
‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è This is also why diverted bupe is so essential. It speaks to a lack of access, even as moderates/vaguely left-of-center politicians tout treatment as the ‚Äòsolution‚Äô to our contaminated drug supply. (Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not.) https://t.co/q5LsELufpJ

A class-wide scheduling of fentanyl is deeply dangerous and directly antithetical to the public claims of support for harm reduction and a desire to shift towards a public health approach.
