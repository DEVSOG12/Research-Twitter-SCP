Biden campaigned on a promise of reducing detention &amp; ending private prisons, but the number of people in immigration detention has *increased* since he took office. The #NewWayForwardAct would end mandatory detention &amp; for-profit detention.

Rooted in white supremacy, ICE is rotten to its core. No matter who's in charge, no amount of culture change can make up for the damage done or prevent the damage yet to be inflicted. The only solution: abolishing ICE and investing in communities.

Lives are in jeopardy under ICE and CBP custody. Every detention and deportation represents a family separation that causes trauma to children, families, and communities. #CommunitiesNotCages

Detention &amp; deportation is fundamentally fraught with inhumane conditions, a lack of accountability and a culture of violence. The alarming death toll of people in ICE and CBP custody proves this fact. #CommunitiesNotCages

Deportation flights to Haiti must be immediately stopped &amp; people seeking safety at our borders must be granted their legally assured chance to seek asylum.
@POTUS: STOP deportations now! #WelcomeWithDignity #StopDeportationFlights #CommunitiesNotCages
The world witnessed horrifying photos of Border Patrol's racist &amp; inhumane treatment of Haitian immigrants, including mass deportation flights. Responsibility for the suffering from these actions falls squarely on @POTUS &amp; will be part of his enduring legacy. #CommunitiesNotCages
There‚Äôs a growing perception that immigration enforcement is less lethal. But the number of immigrants jailed by ICE has increased 70 percent since the start of the Biden administration. Now is the moment to intervene and reverse course @POTUS! #CommunitiesNotCages
Under @POTUS, the cutting of detention contracts has meant the transfer of people to other detention centers instead of their release. This is unacceptable. As detention centers shut down, people must be released rather than transferred or deported, fullstop. #CommunitiesNotCages
The Biden admin is failing to live up to its promises to roll back the detention system by shamefully continuing Trump-era policies &amp; doubling down on the fundamentally flawed detention system. It‚Äôs far past time for @POTUS to act NOW. #CommunitiesNotCages

Detention is never in the best interest of a child. Young people experiencing stress &amp; trauma need the care and support of trusted adults - something that isn‚Äôt possible at influx sites. We must #ReunifyNow #EndTitle42 now.

There is a well-documented history of abuse, neglect, &amp; lack of transparency at influx facilities. Staff at Homestead were hired without proper background checks, resulting in multiple cases of sexual abuse against children. #ReunifyNow #EndTitle42

Policies like Title 42 force families to make the impossible decision of separating at the border. Refusing to allow families to cross the border together is NOT family reunification.

Detention for any length of time inflicts major trauma on all people, &amp; especially children. Incarceration can alter a child's developing nervous system with long-term harm.

Biden was elected on a promise to end family separation &amp; reunite children with their families. Rather than address systemic issues, the Biden administration may expand the use of influx centers.

@potus @vp @secmayorkas @SecBecerra: We won‚Äôt wait anymore. #EndTitle42 #ReunifyNow
Despite repeated reports of abuse, egregious conditions &amp; yrs of community opposition, the T. Don Hutto Detention Center in TX remains open. 

Read @Grassroots_News' report detailing why the facility must be shut down. #ShutDownHutto #CommunitiesNotCages https://t.co/720MNBnJwp https://t.co/TWiG1DsFDJ
