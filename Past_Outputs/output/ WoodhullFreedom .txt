Part of the problem is that law enforcement officers continue to conflate sex work with trafficking.

"The shock and desexualization people often feel after they‚Äôre diagnosed with genital herpes stems from a staggering amount of misinformation swirling around it."

#SexualFreedom is for everyone, including folx with genital herpes

https://t.co/ni2YXgrt7q
Today is the last day of #AceWeek and we thought this was a solid mood to leave off on, but that does not mean that the need for visibility and awareness for asexual folx ends! 

Our mission for #SexualFreedom is one that is for everyone.

"The conversation appears to be entirely focused on the sexual development of cis straight women. Neither actress discusses the role of porn in the self-discovery of queer people."

Sounds rather unproductive and at worst, quite harmful...

Officials learned that most infected soldiers actually contracted their STIs back in their hometowns and not from professional prostitutes. We can see similar misplaced blame and punishment with #FOSTA #SESTA. 

We still have a lot of work to do, huh?

We believe that when we have conversations about abortion, we must focus on all communities affected. It‚Äôs important to grapple with the complexities of abortion, including how it relates to folks with disabilities and fears about eugenics.
